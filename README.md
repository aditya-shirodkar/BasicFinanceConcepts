# BasicFinanceConcepts
This is a text-based game designed to teach basic finance concepts to children aged 8+.

This game covers the following concepts:
1) Simple and compound interest
2) Supply and demand
3) EBIDTA

Of these, the first two include graphical simulations, while the third is purely theoretical.

Some notes:
- To run the game, please execute "game.py"
- The only external module used is plotext, a graph plotting tool which can display graphs on the terminal.
- Further improvements can be made by adding dynamic components to the built simulations, so that they can be used to generate problems which students can then solve.
